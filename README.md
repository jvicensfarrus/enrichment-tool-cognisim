# enrichment-tool-cognisim

Tool created to enrich information from multiple leads with Cognisim through a CSV file.
You will need to upload a csv file(you can check a sample first from in /assets/helpers/) with multiple lead's emails or domains and it will try to enrich all of them though Cognisim.

You will need to update the Cognisim `API-TOKEN` in post.php.

## Notes
The headers 'Email' and 'domain' from csv files are case sensitive and must be kept as they are written.
